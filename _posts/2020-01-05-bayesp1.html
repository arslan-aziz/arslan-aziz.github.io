    Are you someone who's familiar with frequentist statistics but has always been curious about the "other camp"? Well so was I, which is why I took the
    course ISYE 6420: Bayesian Statistics as one of my first classes as part of 
    <a href="url">Georgia Tech Online Master's of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS)</a> in Fall 2020. For my final project, I was interested in using Bayesian
    methods for prediction, especially in a time series context, and a health application captured my interest given by background in biomedical engineering.

    This post serves to kick off a series where I will discuss the work I did in this project and will touch on both Bayesian theory and implementation in PyMC3.
    The four parts will be as follows:

    To kick this off, I want to first give you a quick breakdown of the data I used and how I pulled it together. You can find source code at the 
    <a style="color:inherit" href="url">Github <i class="fa fa-github-square" style="font-size:28px"></i> repository here.</a>
    <br><br>

    What we're trying to achieve is a Bayesian function approximator as follows:<br>
    \(FluIncidence = f(X_1, X_2, X_3, ..., X_k)\)

    I gathered data from four sources to capture the response variable (flu incidence) as well as covariates that could be useful in prediction
    based on a literature review of flu incidence analytics (or more broadly syndromic surveillance).
