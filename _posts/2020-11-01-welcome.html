    Welcome to my blog! I've been interested in writing more about my thoughts related to technology, science, and my explorations.
    <br><br>
    I hope to add posts here on a regular basis to relay my experiences from my professional experience, personal projects, and coursework.
    I think the broad nature of work I touch from analytics to computer science to software engineering, etc. has some interesting intersections
    that I could tease out better when I write them out.
    <br><br>
    Some of the topics I've been mulling discussing are related to my Bayesian statistics coursework to help myself and hopefully others understand
    practical applications where the Bayesian way presents a clear advantage.
    I also would like to share my current experiences building my Food for Thought application and some of the architectural choices that went into building
    an NLP-driven software application.
    Finally, it's been some time since I've been able to explore image processing topics but would like to try my hand at implementing traditional segmentation algorithms such as active contours or level sets since I've always found those fascinating.

    Thanks for taking the time to check out my website and please keep an eye out for the next blog post!
