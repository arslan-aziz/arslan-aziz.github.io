    Are you someone who's familiar with frequentist statistics but has always been curious about the "other camp"? Well so was I, which is why I took the
    course ISYE 6420: Bayesian Statistics as one of my first classes as part of 
    <a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech Online Master's of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS)</a> in Fall 2020. For my final project, I was interested in using Bayesian
    methods for prediction, especially in a time series context, and a health application captured my interest given by background in biomedical engineering.

    This post serves to kick off a series where I will discuss the work I did in this project and will touch on both Bayesian theory and implementation in PyMC3.
    The four parts will be as follows:

    To kick this off, I want to first give you a quick breakdown of the data I used and how I pulled it together.
    I gathered data from four sources to capture the response variable (flu incidence) as well as covariates that could be useful in prediction
    based on a literature review of flu incidence analytics (or more broadly syndromic surveillance). Important factors included external factors such
    as season and population density as well as an individual's personal health. The following data sources were identified:

    Unemploymed population was included to capture the mental and health effects of economic stress with which unemployment 
    has been shown to be strongly correlated. Data were pulled accordingly with the Data Source Type and aggregated
    to the monthly and U.S. state levels.

    In the <a href="https://arslan-aziz.com/2020/01/05/bayesp1.html">next post</a> we'll discuss Bayesian linear regression and dive into our first implementation using Bayesian methods to fit
    the following regression equation:<br>
