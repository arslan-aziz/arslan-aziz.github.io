Some notes on how to write my blog post(s) on my Bayesian Statistics Course Final project:

1. What is the aim?
    - Share my understanding of Bayesian statistics (theory and example).
    - Demonstrate my knowledge of Bayesian statistics.

2. What are the major parts of my project?
    - Data munging:
    - Bayesian regression:
    - GP regression:
    - Model evaluation:
    - Modeling results (comparison):
    - Using PyMC3: 

3. What's missing?
    - Comparison with traditional regression approach:
