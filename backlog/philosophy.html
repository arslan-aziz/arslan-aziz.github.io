    <h4><b>My Journey</b></h4>
    <p>
        I completed my undergraduate from the University of Virginia (UVA) in 2019 and took away many lessons from my experiences and mentors
        that have helped shape and guide me to this day. But it really boils down to the following: 
        <ol>
            <li>Strive to leave the world in a better place than when you entered.</li>
            <li>Don't bite off more than you can chew.</li>
            <li>Anyone can be a leader.</li>
        </ol>
        1. and 2. are seemingly contradictory, but the wisdom of 2. is that "world" is the scope in which you can make meaningful change. 
        Finally, 3. is the means to make that change; a leader is anyone who steps up to advocate their ideas.<br>
        I am an engineer in the broadest sense who has worked on electric cars, biomedical microscopes, and microfluidic devices. Combined with my natural
        interest in statistics and probability, I am excited by opportunities to build intelligent systems that can help make a positive difference.

    <p>
        <b>What do I care about?</b> I am someone who is excited by tough challenges and has worked in multiple different domains, 
        but at the end of the day I am an engineer enthusiastic about building systems and tools as well as a data scientist excited about using statistics 
        and machine learning to investigating patterns in data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What is my background?</b> I graduated from the University of Virginia in Spring 2019 with a double major in biomedical engineering and statistics. 
        At the University I worked for 3.5 years as a research assistant in a biomedical microsopy lab where I worked on every aspect of the microscopy 
        pipeline from sample culturing to optics to image processing.<br>
        After completing my undergraduate I further pursued my interest in biomedical imaging with an internship as a Janelia Undergraduate Scholar at the 
        Howard Hughes Medical Institute where I dived head first into state-of-the-art computer vision techniques and built an integer linear program 
        to reconstruct CNN segmentations of eukaryotic cell volumes acquired via FIB-SEM tomography.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What am I doing right now?</b> I am currently a Data Scientist at the Logistics Management Institute solving some of the federal government's 
        hardest challenges using data-driven approaches. I have worked on end-to-end advanced analytics engagements from use case development and data munging
        to statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization. I am also currently completing an MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech remotely
        and part-time where I can further chase my natural curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What are my skillsets?</b> In my professional experience, I have been able to leverage and grow my academic background to build a flexible
        and strong analytics skillset. I have processed and performed analytics on structured and unstructured data (image and text) using statistical,
        machine learning, and optimization techniques. I understand when to apply different levels of analytics (descriptive to predictive) and the methods
        behind doing so. I can work with data whether it comes in a spreadsheet, is accessed through a web API, exists in a database, or lives in 
        Hadoop Distribured File System (HDFS).<br> On my engineering side, I have analytics software development experience through self-driven projects and 
        professional work. I work flexibly across languages with Python and Java being my strongest ones and also including JavaScript, R, SQL, and C/C++.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How am I growing?</b> I aspire to grow deep skillsets in both computer science and analytics to help contribute to the next generation of 
        tools and technologies powering our current AI revolution. I continue to grow my career, develop my personal projects, and tailor my coursework 
        toward that aim.
